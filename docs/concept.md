# Process, Project, People

What do we want to know about the iterative development process, the people involved in it and the project emerging as a result?

The same process event may be relevant to several different facets.

E.g. changes have been merged -> 

- **people**: a person contributed to the project as (stacks: front-end vs back-end) developer in (languages: C#, JS, SQL, etc.) using (toolsets: `HttpClient`, `Fls.Results`, `Mongo`)
- **process**: last gap or delay history item is closed and an updated code change info record is saved
- **project**:code change is added to completed list
